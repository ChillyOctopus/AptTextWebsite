The code for the startup website - HTML, CSS, ect. This repo contains all of that information and code.

What is this startup? Housing is an enormous problem for students in Provo. One of the facets of this issue is understanding availability. Landlords must maintain accurate records, and communicate these to students. This communication for availabiliyt takes valuable time for both students and landlords. My startup would handle this by allowing apartment complexs to update a databse and students will be able to see that in real time.
